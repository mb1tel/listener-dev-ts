# Task List for Socket.IO Multiple Instances Project

## Phase 1: Basic Setup

### 1. Setup Development Environment
- [x] Create a setup.py script to automatically generate the project directory tree.
- [x] Initialize a Node.js project with npm  
  Create the main directory named "socketio" at the same level as test simulation folders.  
  ```bash
  cd socketio
  npm init -y
  ```
- [x] Install basic dependencies  
  ```bash
  npm install socket.io express dotenv winston ioredis '@socket.io/redis-adapter'
  npm install --save-dev nodemon typescript @types/node @types/express
  ```
- [x] Configure TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`)
- [x] Set up main project folder structure  
  ```
  /socketio
    /config
    /models
    /services
    /utils
    /controllers
    /middleware
    /types
    server.ts
  ```
- [x] Set up simulation folder structure; each folder corresponds to a service in Docker Compose  
  ```
  /nginx
  /public
  /webhook
  /redis
  ```
- [x] Create a Docker Compose file outside the main project directory, including all mockable services
  `redis` container — simulates a standalone Redis instance
  `socketio` service with 3 replicas — simulates multiple Socket.IO instances
  `nginx` using the nginx:alpine image and volume mount ./nginx/nginx.conf — simulates the load balancer
  `webhook` — simulates the Webhook Server
  `public` — simulates the Web Client Demo

### 2. Deploy a Basic Socket.IO Server
- [x] Create a basic Express server
- [x] Integrate Socket.IO into the Express server
- [x] Add Socket.IO event handlers
- [x] Write basic tests to verify connection

## Phase 2: Redis Adapter Integration

### 3. Setup Simulated Redis
- [x] Use Docker Compose to simulate Redis, build: ./redis
- [x] Configure Redis connection
- [x] Test connection to Redis server

### 4. Integrate Socket.IO Redis Adapter
- [x] Initialize Redis adapter for Socket.IO
- [x] Configure pub/sub with ioredis (duplicate connection)
- [x] Test broadcasting messages between instances
- [x] Configure adapter options and optimizations

### 5. Session and State Management
- [x] Design state storage in Redis
- [x] Implement state synchronization mechanism
- [x] Handle client reconnection
- [x] Build a client connection tracking mechanism

## Phase 3: Expansion and Optimization

### 6. Set Up Logging System
- [x] Configure Winston logger
- [x] Implement log rotation
- [x] Define log levels and formats
- [x] Create middleware for logging Socket.IO events

### 7. Configure Load Balancer
- [x] Simulate Nginx, build: ./nginx
- [x] Set up sticky sessions
- [x] Test and optimize performance

## Phase 4: Security and Advanced Features

### 8. Implement Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Add authentication middleware for Socket.IO
- [ ] Configure JWT for authentication
- [ ] Implement CORS and security measures
- [ ] Add rate limiting checks

### 9. Error Handling and Resilience
- [x] Implement global exception handling
- [x] Build recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Set up circuit breakers for external services
- [ ] Configure timeout and retry policies

### 10. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Perform benchmarking and profiling
- [ ] Optimize memory usage
- [ ] Reduce communication latency
- [ ] Implement caching techniques

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

### 11. Write Tests
- [ ] Install testing framework (Jest/Mocha)  
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest
  ```
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Write load and stress tests

### 12. Setup CI/CD
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions or Jenkins
- [ ] Create build and test pipeline
- [ ] Define automated deployment process
- [ ] Set up post-deployment monitoring

### 13. Documentation and Guides
- [x] Write API documentation
- [x] Create diagrams and flowcharts
- [ ] Write deployment guides
- [x] Update README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines

## Discovered During Work

### Additional Tasks
- [x] Implement client count tracking across instances
- [x] Create a UI that displays connection status and instance ID
- [x] Build a better testing interface for webhook testing
- [ ] Implement message persistence in Redis for missed messages
- [ ] Add support for private messaging between clients
- [ ] Create a monitoring dashboard for system health
- [ ] Extend message system with support for different message types (image, file, location, etc.)
- [ ] Implement typing indicators and read receipts
